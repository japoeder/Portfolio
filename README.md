## Projects

This project applies various classification models such as Logistic Regression (pytorch & sklearn), Random Forest, and XGBoost to solve an import origination problem in the credit risk space. The models for the most part have comparable accuracy metrics aside from xgboost, which may perform better with some additional fine tuning.

This Instacart basket analysis is focused on understanding customer purchasing patterns using a dataset containing 3 million grocery orders from over 200,000 Instacart users. The files encompasse a variety of data on order details, product information, and the order in which products were added to the cart.
